  The Performing Arts play a hugely significant role in helping students to develop their creative skills. Educational theorists are increasingly emphasising the importance of “emotional intelligence”, developing a creative mind and fostering personalities and imaginations as students make their journey through school, to become happy and well rounded individuals.

While Performing Arts allow students to develop creative passions, they simultaneously teach students language and communication skills, helping them to communicate effectively with others with confidence.

Performing Arts are all about self expression, exploring alternative options and embracing individuality. It’s not black and white, or about right or wrong answers, and this allows students to develop self confidence and belief in themselves. With improved self confidence and self belief, comes a natural pathway for students to go on to master many more skills that will equip them for life.

Studies have also indicated that students who participate in Performing Arts can enjoy improved performance in more traditionally academic subject such as mathematics and English.
